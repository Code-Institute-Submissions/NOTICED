# NØTICED LUXURY FASHION WEBSITE
This project is a website to showcase items of clothing, footwear and face masks which may be supplied directly via the website.

NØTICED is a luxury fashion brand, so we expect a luxury feel in the user experience of the website with detailed information about the items.


## UX
The UX starts at the ‘Home Page’ which will feature rich imagery exuding a great feeling of quality and aspirational luxury to introduce the site.
The top banner will include navigation with the Nøticed signature logo.

The clientele having been used to promotions on Instagram will now experience a great rich media experience creating the luxury brand awareness that the proprietor craves.

The site is Responsive acieved using Bootstrap 4 "row and columns", tested for Web, Mobile Phones & Tablets.

for the text, making them more vivid.

## Deployment
Deployment has been done using Github Pages
https://g-dev-01.github.io/NOTICED/index.html

Github offers a hosting facility for static web pages, this is quite staright forward if you have a Github account
and repository for your code. 

Publishing may be done from any of the branches in a repository.

For this website I have used 'master' with the view that enhancements may be made on other branches which may then be merged to master once it is working satisfactorily
this has been achieved by following the instructions at the link below under credits.
From the G-Dev-01 Repository, I clicked on Settings and scrolled down to Github Pages in order to select the source, in this case this was the master main branch/root.

Clicked on Save

Website was automatically published on Github pages at the follwing link which was indicated on the settings page.
https://g-dev-01.github.io/NOTICED/

Github Pages is designed to host personal, organisation or project pages from a Github repository.

## Content
The Code consists of a number of elements; header, footer, which are common across all pages and the Main Section which is unique to each page.

Styling across the different Main Sections of the site has as similar esthetic. 

### Header
The header section featuring the 'Navigation Bar'.
Bootstrap is used to divide the screen using the Row & Columns philosophy

The first 3rd of the Navigation Bar features the NØTICED logo with the remaining two-thirds reserved for the navigation menu. To complement the logo and provide a seamless elegant look, black was selected for the back-ground colour.

### Footer
The footer section is taken form the Rosie Odenkirk Exercise & modified for use here. Links aare provided for the home pages of the social media sites for illustration, as the website is not curretly active.

### Main Sections
For the 'Home' Page the main section features rich imagery exuding a great feeling of quality and aspirational luxury to introduce the site.
with a strap line quotation form the proprietor.

In the future this can be made more elaborate with a carousel or promotional video.

'About', similarly is a simplified page introducing the origins of the brand, highlighting its organic development.

'Selection' uses the BootStrap philosphy to showcase three items with individual styling and the addition of a 'Buy item' button which links to a purchasing modal, the form was adapted from a template from Tutorialzine. 
In order to preserve the user experience of the site on small devices Selection displays a single item per page on a small screen 

'Contact' is the last page and features an form for taking contact details.
