# NØTICED LUXURY FASHION WEBSITE

This project is a website to showcase items of clothing, footwear and face masks which may be supplied directly via the website.

NØTICED is a luxury fashion brand, so we expect a luxury feel in the user experience of the website with detailed information about the items.


## UX
The UX starts at the ‘Home Page’ which will feature rich imagery exuding a great feeling of quality and aspirational luxury to introduce the site.
The top banner will include navigation with the Nøticed signature logo.

The clientele having been used to promotions on Instagram will now experience a great rich media experience creating the luxury brand awareness that the proprietor craves.

## Testing
For this first phase testing is limited to a visual inspection of the pages; noting the fuctionality of the navigation bar, use of imagery as well as the look & feel of the site.

The site is Responsive, tested for Web, Mobile Phones & Tablets.

Initially the site was produced using desk top as the reference, however during testing the view on iPad was not representative, so the font weights and sizes were modified
