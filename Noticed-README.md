# NØTICED LUXURY FASHION WEBSITE

This project is a website to showcase items of clothing, footwear and face masks which may be supplied directly via the website.

NØTICED is a luxury fashion brand, so we expect a luxury feel in the user experience of the website with detailed information about the items.


## UX
The UX starts at the ‘Home Page’ which will feature rich imagery exuding a great feeling of quality and aspirational luxury to introduce the site.
The top banner will include navigation with the Nøticed signature logo.

The clientele having been used to promotions on Instagram will now experience a great rich media experience creating the luxury brand awareness that the proprietor craves.

## Technologies Used

Bootstrap 4


## Testing
For this first phase testing is limited to a visual inspection of the pages; noting the fuctionality of the navigation bar, use of imagery as well as the look & feel of the site.

The site is Responsive, tested for Web, Mobile Phones & Tablets.

Initially the site was produced using desk top as the reference, however during testing the view on iPad was not representative, so the font weights and sizes were modified
for the text making them more vivid.

## Deployment
Deployment has been done using Github Pages
https://g-dev-01.github.io/NOTICED/index.html

Github offers a hosting facility for static web pages, this is quite staright forward if you have a Github account
and repository for your code. 

Publishing may be done from any of the branches in a repository.

For this website I have used 'master' with the view that enhancements may be made on other branches which may then be merged to master once it is working satisfactorily
this has been achieved by following the instructions at the link below under credits.
From the G-Dev-01 Repository, I clicked on Settings and scrolled down to Github Pages in order to select the source, in this case this was the master main branch/root.

Clicked on Save

Website was automatically published on Github pages at the follwing link which was indicated on the settings page.
https://g-dev-01.github.io/NOTICED/

Github Pages is designed to host personal, organisation or project pages from a Github repository.
